Issue #1260:
This is a bug min demo for vs prompting error. The code is right, you can new a project for testing. URL: https://github.com/kelicto/ReferenceErrorBug.git.

Now, I already know the reason, bacause the language version is 7.1 in project file. So, the prompting happended. Please fix it and tell me explicit reason. If the version exist some bugs, please check it and fix it, because it's very important and substantive. Thanks!

The language version 7.3 is ok, so, old versions exist the some bugs and I think need to fix, orelse don't allow define non supported overload methods and should not say xxx parameters problems, It's very terrible.
